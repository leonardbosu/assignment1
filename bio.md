<header>Barry Leonard's Bio:</header>

Hello! My name is Barry Leonard and I currently live in San Diego, California! I work as a polymer chemist for a biotech company, making fluorescent dyes used in biomedical imaging applications. I am working through OSU's inline post-bass program with the hopes that I can begin to develop applications for use in biotech, and potentially shifting over to a field like chemoinformatics! In my free time I like to sail, surf, hike, brew beer and play instruments! I'm hoping to be able to sail to California's off shore islands by this summer. I am also planning on headed to Coachella!

<header>Programming background:</header>

I had minimal programming experience before starting this program. I messed around with HTML in middle school (geocities woot!) but nothing since then. I had some exposure to matlab and maple and mathematical in my chemistry undergrad, but nothing since then. Before starting this program I participated in a few MOOCs that uses python, java, and ML languages. 

I am enjoying my courses so far for the most part (boo assembly). My favorite part so far has bene the minesweeper game I made in CS162. It was quite fun. I've been looking forward to this class; I hope to be able to gain more "practical" skills. I'd like to create an online portfolio for myself. I am also considering rolling out a wiki for my workplace; CSS would be helpful in branding an off-the-shelf solution I think.
