<header>Barry Leonard's Bio:</header>

Hello! My name is Barry Leonard and I currently live in San Diego, California! I work as a polymer chemist for a biotech company, making fluorescent dyes used in biomedical imaging applications. I am working through OSU's inline post-bass program with the hopes that I can begin to develop applications for use in biotech, and potentially shifting over to a field like chemoinformatics! In my free time I like to sail, surf, hike, brew beer and play instruments!

<header>Programming background:</header>

I had minimal programming experience before starting this program. I messed around with HTML in middle school (geocities woot!) but nothing since then. I had some exposure to matlab and maple and mathematical in my chemistry undergrad, but nothing since then.
